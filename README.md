If env is already made, load environment

`source load_env.sh`

After the env is ready, run specific experiments using script in `shell_scripts/`

`sbatch specific_exp_scritps`

All visualizations and figures are generated using jupyter notebooks, see `analysis_in_notebooks/`

Code base is located in `lib/`; python scripts for experiments are in `exps/`

All Figures can be found in `analysis_in_notebooks/`
